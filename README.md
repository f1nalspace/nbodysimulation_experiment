# nbodysimulation_experiment
Multi-Threaded N-Body 2D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Fluid Simulation
Based on paper "Particle-based Viscoelastic Fluid Simulation" by Simon Clavet, Philippe Beaudoin, and Pierre Poulin

A experiment about creating a two-way particle simulation in 4 different programming styles to see the difference in performance and maintainability.
The core math is same for all implementations, including rendering and threading.
